Like that title? I trained a neural net on Medium article titles and Reddit topics. I guess your question, punk, is whether this whole article is artificial.

There is no question that Machine Learning is over-hyped and will suffer through the trough of disillusionment. The question we should ask is how this will happen? Will we all start using ML until there’s a critical failure (a 3-mile AIsland) and pull back? Or will we find that ML makes all our services much far more susceptible to cyber attacks? 

Nope.

It’s the data, stupid.
