### The Geordi Effect

When Star Trek: The Next Generation first debuted, we met Geordi LaForge. He was the lead engineer of the Starship Enterprise, and true to LaVar Burton, he was unstoppably optimistic. Geordi was blind and forced to wear Spandex, but that didn’t matter because he had a V.I.S.O.R. 

About a week after the first episode (in kid years), a science journal claimed that blindness would soon be a thing of the past, thanks to super smart lasers. Geordi, a genius from 200 years in the future, suddenly seemed hopelessly passe. 

His pal Data faired even worse. Data was a lime-sorbet robot that, if nothing else, predicted the decades of sexually-repressed mutant/vampire/zombies striving for self-actualization in an oppressive world. Data is only useful as a teenage metaphor because everything else about him was, immediately, hopelessly outdated:

-   This android had an off-switch positioned right where you’d pull the chord on talky doll from the fifties. 
-   This android didn’t have wifi, he had to be “hard-wired” into the “mainframe.”
-   This android had trouble with contractions.
-   This was the first android ever in the 2300 century. Okay, sure.

It’s pretty clear that if Data were imagined today, he’d be called Google Data and you’d never see him. 

### I come here not to bury Star Trek, but to praise it. 

At the time, I thought ST:TNG (Star Trek: The Next Generation) was about as relevant as Matlock.

The writers of Star Trek were focused on upgrading their universe to predictions of the 90’s. No one could’ve predicted tech’s hyperbolic curve that we’ve been privy to for the last twenty years.

 In fact, every sci-fi show since has tended toward the apocalyptic and violent future. Not only does it validate the show as more visceral than ST:TNG, it also absolves them of imaging a future that people could aspire to.

The, when they were upgrading the Enterprise and its inhabitants to the 90's, couldn’t have predicted the degree of technological innovation that has become normal for us. The starship had already sailed.

EnterpriseUX feels the same.

### What is Enterprise UX?

EnterpriseUX is only a few years old and it is difficult to describe.

When it’s done wrong, it’s basically “lipstick on a pig.” A slick new interface, dropdown menus, AJAX(!), and “Responsive.” The end result is a contorted mix of cosmetic flourishes and ancient business logic. I call it **Cougarware**.

When Enterprise UX is done well, its part of a cultural transformation. A new C-level exec joins the team and with grand dreams of transforming the company into the next Apple. 

This is both good and bad. It’s good because without a top-level mandate, UX is just archeology. UX experts make slideshows that get filed away in a massive archive, like the Holy Grail in the Indiana Jones movie. 

Enterprise UX is sort of a loose cannon.

EnterpriseUX is like the guy that’s about to lose his wife because he still wears cargo pants and he’s willing to do anything, ANYTHING, to keep her. And B2C is Fabio, all muscly and inattached, the future is a mystery!, 

Its bad because the transformation is not organic. It always resembles a reformation rather than transformation. 

Think about any of the Toy Story movies. 

Transformation at this scale is worthy of examination in own right, because it is never as simple as the name implies. Its different in every company, but it usually resembles one of the Toy Story movies. The toys are happy where they’re at, its the C-level kid that grows up. 

A C-level exec has to be the arbiter of change. 

For the last two years, the EnterpriseUX conference in San Antonio has focused on cultural change in large corporations, not pattern libraries or research techniques. Enterprise UX is not possible without a mandate from a far up the food chain. And even with the best intentions, such a mandate trickles down the chain of command like a game of pochucho. By the time it gets to production, who knows what flavor of EUX will 

often instigated by some C-level champion. Agility has become an agenda. It order to survive, we must be quick! 

  

  

realized that the product can’t change without serious shifts in corporate culture. This is Conway’s Law made manifest and it’s always exciting to see. 

At this level, User Experience goes far beyond the product into the user experience of the company. 

Most of the talks 

  

### How Did Enterprise UX get started?

_Some speculative fiction on how Enterprise UX got started._

After a few corporations started to sink due to something called “disruption,” C-Level execs got scared.
