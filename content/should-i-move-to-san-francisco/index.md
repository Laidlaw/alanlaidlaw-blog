This is an open letter to the tech community.

I just returned to Nashville from San Francisco. Nashville is blowing up. Judging by the traffic, everyone is moving here. I have several opportunities with jobs I can pour my heart and soul into. I have no reason to leave. 

The fractalization of technology has been a blessing to many Southern cities. We’re catching on to the subtle Silicon Valley rituals like a child that catches a native tongue. We’re catching up.

On the surface, the struggle to leave or stay is obvious. There is a fish, a pond, and variables. It’s machine learning.

I went to San Francisco last week to go to a conference on Deep Learning. I paid for it out my own pocket (which was a deep lesson, let me tell you). I’m not a back-end developer and I had no reason to be there. When other attendees asked why I was there, I made up elaborate products on the fly. It’s a great exercise, you should try it.

Every year I go to a conference I have no reason to attend. I fake it. I make a fool of myself. When I was younger, I crashed weddings, art exhibits, and reunions. You learn alot about people that way — but only if you aren’t focused on yourself. 

Andrew Ng, who taught a groundbreaking course on machine learning (free on Coursera), turned me on to the idea of unsupervised learning. Drones figure out how to fly through broken windows by using unsupervised learning. 

I’ve been doing unsupervised learning all my life. Next to the Deep Learning Summit was a summit on Virtual Assistants. I sneaked in.

The two conferences were quite different in tone. At first, the Virtual Assistants Summit seemed mannequin-esque. How do you make something inanimate seem human to the degree that it serves your purposes? It was a Mechanical Turk summit. You can gussy it up as UX, but it’s basically about making a scarecrow seem real. 

Meanwhile, over at the Deep Learning Summit, I was watching talks about the limits of the algorithms themselves. They were close to human cognition, but not accurate enough. 

However, what the algorithms managed to unravel was fantasmagorical. They permutated at a scale beyond the pale. Patches of the Earth recorded for 40 years revealed patterns of poverty, traffic, and opportunity. Deep Learning redefined global opportunities to the highest bidder.

Speakers fell into two camps. One dealt with algorithms, and perhaps because they were all PhDs, they deftly avoided sweeping statements about the potential of Deep Learning. It was as if they were saying, “Mom! I’m almost done! Just 30 more minutes!”

The others bloviated about infinite potential of their new toy and how they’ve transmuted deep learning into dolla bills ya’ll. “Here’s how Deep Learning helps artists find new photos of shoes to make collages to send to their moms. We all know how moms love shoes.” I’m exaggerating out of respect for the forlorn academics that dedicated their lives to the unexpected application of shoe wayfinding. 

When asked about how Deep Learning will change us, Andrew Ng compared it to trains. We didn’t treat trains like horses. Trains didn’t stop when we stepped in front of them. Trains trained us. 

One wonders what Steve jobs would do if he’d seen this. “One wonders what George Orwell would think if he’d seen this,” was a line from a book I was listening to at the time and it echoed. The book is called Information, by James Gleick. 

In the history of Information, there is a moment where two new ideas emerge at the same time: Information Theory and Cybernetics. They vie for control of the public and academic imagination. 

I was seeing the same thing play out in front of my eyes. One summit was about defining patterns in massive amounts of information through algorithms and the other was about how to get machines to act like humans. 

The synchrony was overwhelming. 

We all have moments in life that seem too predestined to make sense. Sometimes it’s called dejavu — it has some stench of the psychic. I like to call it unsupervised learning. It is the euphoric association of unrelated qualia. I sincerely hope machines feel it too. 

The funny thing about these sensations is that never predict destiny. They are just moments. They are pregnant moments that fill us with gratitude. There is no plan behind them.

Virtual assistants are trains painted like horses. They are a stopgap for a relationship with machines that we can’t comprehend right now. The real question is how much we need to adapt to them.

I was walking around San Francisco after the two summits. Yelp told me there was a bar nearby that had a lot of stars. I walked in. The place was thin. There wasn’t room to get lost, just a spot at the bar on the edge. The drunk next to me started talking loosely. Turns out he was a bartender and a comedian and not drunk — an act. We talked about San Fran and AIDS as comic fodder. I left and walked uphill to a meetup. 

The meetup was about conversational interfaces and there was pizza. We talk conversational interfaces in Nashville and we have pizza. Been there. But this was a panel of founders, we don’t get founders often. 

When I hear stories of San Francisco, I don’t hear about the pragmatism. I only hear about the exponential valuations, the real estate, the immortality. I met a few demi-gods and they were refreshingly practical. Maybe it was a script, it’s possible, it’s probable, but the pragmatism is palpable. 

I came to San Francisco to learn the code. Or see if there was a code. I don’t mean Free Masons and I don’t mean Node. I mean a subtext, a subtle set of values you must suggest in order to get a job. I found that there was one, but you won’t undercover it in conversation.

When my friends ask me why I want to move to San Francisco, I bring up the locusts. Locusts, when they swarm, shed their skin. Their bodies become smaller as their brains become larger. Their brains are navigational tools and they have to be firing non-stop in the swarm to calculate every potential crash. They get thin and smart because they’re in a crowd. Fuck I believe that story.

  

  

  

It’s insane how scripted you have to be in order to be considered for a 

  

I was certain that there was a code. It doesn’t come through To all you people that are in charge of hiring new talent: I don’t think you’ve got it figured out yet. You side with the comfortable parlance and dismiss 

They saw through the rhetoric the same way the deep learning academics saw through the enthusiasm that filled the summits. Technology can bring anything unexpectedly. From a distance, it is very difficult to tell what has legs.
