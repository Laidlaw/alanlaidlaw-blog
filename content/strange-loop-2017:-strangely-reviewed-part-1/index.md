I just got back from the Strange Loop Conference in St. Louis and started to record my thoughts on Anchor. (First time podcaster, so go easy on me.)

If you haven’t heard of Strange Loop, you should really check it out. I can’t think of another tech conference like this one. The talks range from enterprise-level system architecture problems to tech-as-art transhumanism to genetic algorithm AIs to screenwriting AIs to Google’s new game-changing mobile framework (look, I’ll just give you a list to the talks below) to the ethical responsibility of technologists in 2017. That last theme was particularly poignant given that the conference was in St. Louis.

The kickoff party was held at City Museum, a phantasmagoric playground of stairs, slides and secret passages in the heart of St Louis. It reminded me of the state of software development today, which reminded me of an earlier Strange Loop talk by Joe Armstrong called “The Mess We’re In.”



The name of the conference comes from Gödel, Escher, Bach — a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Douglas Hoffsteadter — that reads like an artificial intelligence learning how to learn about our world from the minds of a mathematician, a painter, a musician, and a tortoise.

Strange Loop is also the effect one gets while listening to these talks. If Hoffsteadter is right that analogy is the core of cognition, this conference puts that theory to the test.

By end of the day on Saturday, my mind was worn out. I couldn’t handle another talk on AI so picked a safe talk about [UX challenges when translating content to different languages](https://youtu.be/xpumLsaAWGw).



Within a few minutes, I realized I was in too deep. Hebrew, a right-to-left language, has to nest left-to-right subsentences like compound numbers within the parent entity. This gets even more complex if you consider that the interface is also a language. In an interface, words can be form or content, medium or message. How can autosuggest work under these conditions?

Getting dizzy, my mind reached back to Metamagical Themas, Douglas Hoffsteadter’s recursive column for Scientific American in 80’s. He picked a trivial problem language problem, self-referential sentences, and went on forever about it:

-   _If this sentence didn’t exist, somebody would have invented it._
-   If I had finished this sentence,
-   If there were no counterfactuals, this sentence would not be paradoxical.
