_Phrases perform functions._

**Thinking words** are words or phrases that perform functions. When you say “_Siri_” or “_Ok, Google_” — those are **thinking words**.

LOL is now universally understood to mean “_Laugh Out Loud_,” but there were a few years where that was up for grabs. If the moms of America had their way, LOL would still mean “_Lots of Love._”

In programming terms, LOL is an abstraction layer, a shortcut. And it does a great job if you interpret it correctly. But it also forces your mom into a classic programming conundrum. LOL is an **interpreted language** and your mom now has to run extra process cycles to decode LOL into “Laugh Out Loud.”

If LOL were a **compiled language**, when you typed L-O-L and hit “send,” the phone would decode the message and she would read “Laugh Out Loud” (or perhaps even “_Oh my gosh Mom, that is so funny. I love you!_”). And she would be happy, for once.

But then aren’t all text messages a kind of interpreted language? We misunderstand people all the time, in text and in person, so isn’t all communication interpreted? 

This is the critical difference between our spoken language and machine language. Our language doesn’t compile down to ones and zeroes. It is not reducible, but malleable. It morphs to its environment. 

  

### //Notes to self 

(This gets confusing quick. when we type anything in a phone, it’s getting compiled and is therefore a compiled language. But we don’t see that, we only see its lossless rendering. So when I say compiled language, I mean words that speak directly to the computer.)

Software eats the world, bitches. — Marc Andreessen

 In the same way that writing was relegated to scholars and is now part of our daily routine, so coding will become an unconscious habit.

That doesn’t mean you should drop everything and join a code school, today’s languages don’t matter — you won’t be making web pages. 

Instead, you will use **thinking words.**  

Metatags, macros, bash, shell, git, and markdown are all examples of 

I made up this term out of desperation because programmers use these words every day but, to my knowledge, there isn’t a unifying phrase for it. In the command-line interface, it can be called shell scripting or bash. But it also includes CLIs like git or markdown. When you activate Siri, Google, or Alexi with a word rather than a button, you are using a **thinking word**.

  

Continuing from Part 1, we challenge some ideas previously mentioned and attempt to hone them somewhat.

LOL, #whut?

In Part 1, I wondered what it would sound like if HTML became infused in our language. Would it change the way we think? 

It seems like we’ve already taken to this.
