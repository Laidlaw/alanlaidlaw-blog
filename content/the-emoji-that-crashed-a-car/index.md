Let’s start with Don Norman’s doorknob. A doorknob is so well-designed that you immediately know how to use it. A mirror is an even better example. A mirror is so intuitive, it doesn’t even seem artificial.

If the doorknob becomes sluggish, you notice it immediately. If the sluggishness lasts long enough, you might squirt some WD-40. If the doorknob stops working altogether, you get a replacement. You do not sit around waiting for a software update.

But that is exactly what I’ve been doing. After Apple’s latest iPhone update, I have to press every email link twice. Sending a text requires a thumb dance.

The slightest misstep will trigger an ethereal bubble gum realm of lasers and balloons. It’s intended to be an instant message massage. The UI is saying, “I‘m a new feature! Have some fun in your life, you sad little blister.” (paraphrasing the UI, of course.)

Admittedly, if I knew that all I had to do was twist the doorknob a little harder for confetti to blast me in the face, I’d do it. I’d do it when I was mad at myself. But most of the time, I don’t want to think about my doorknob. I don’t want my doorknob to think about me. If my doorknob is thinking anything, I’d like it to be “How can I be more like Mirror?”

This is not a rant against technology. Software is eating the world, and Apple is letting us eat cake. (And stuff our texts with balloons and lasers.) This is a rant against products.

This happened to my boss’s friend. He gets a new Lincoln MKZ with a cockpit computer. It pairs with the phone, has a touchscreen, the works.

 But the computer starts freezing up. Not for a few minutes, for an entire commute. The guy calls the dealership, frantic. They run diagnostics, can’t find anything. They reinstall the OS. It’s fine for a little while, but then it happens again. Blue screen of death.

Imagine driving in traffic with your daughter strapped in the passenger seat. You’re both staring at the screen. Could the brakes lock up? Will the windshield wipers flip out?

Turns out, the daughter had emojis in her contacts list, next to names. Snapchat generation. The computer didn’t understand emojis, so when it tried to pair to her phone, the car crashed.

😂

No one died in that story. But before things get too dark, here’s a riddle:

> If a tree falls in a forest, but the forest has bad wifi, does the forest exist?

In other words, if a utility has it’s insides rewritten, it is still a utility?

Simon Wardley understands utilities. He starts with utilities. When he hears “Apple” or “Facebook,” he thinks of the underlying utilities that makes those products possible. Wardley maps are the equivalent of exploded technical diagrams. The maps breakdown each dependency inside the product offering 

  

  

He’s made a career out of predicting paradigms shifts in technology. 

When we hear the words “Apple” or “Tesla,” we think of the product and brand. Mr. Wardley, by contrast, sees a geneology. 

You’ve heard how lightning actually starts from the ground and 

looks at the all the underlying dependencies. He maps those dependencies to a matrix of visibility and evolution. The more evolved a dependency is, more likely it is going to work in the background. Electricity is a good example. We rely on it about as much as we rely on the sun, if not more.

  

What follows is not a technology rant. This is a product rant. 

After all, the pace of technology can’t be stopped. Software is eating the world. All that jazz.
