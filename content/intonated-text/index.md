#### Intonated Text is a gestural syntax channel for nonverbal communication.

  

This article explores the concept and the 

#### Texting how we speak to each other in distributed non-local conversations.

-   Texting is more like talking than writing.
-   An incredible amount of contextual information is lost when we text. We lose empathy and understanding of the other person.

We think that texting has fundamentally changed the we way we talk to each other, potentially leading to the breakdown in a national conversation that we’re all experiencing.

When we talk to another person in person, we read their gestures, posture and pauses — not just their words.

Written language was not designed for interpersonal conversational dynamics. Conversations have no authors. Implicit meanings are threaded with explicit topics.

\## Compression  
Texting is quicker than talking. ‘K’ or :) is quicker than typing. We are constantly compressing how we talk to each other.  
Compression allows for greater immediacy, but comes with a cost.  
We lose context, situational awareness and empathy.   
How many times has a simple ‘k’ led to a fight?

Even when there are higher fidelity methods available, like voice memos, they haven’t caught on. Emojis and animated gifs are standard.   
Texting is more like talking than recordings of ourselves talking.

Texting, which should really be thought of as a pidgin language, are evolving to fill in the gaps that written words alone cannot fill.

Emoji and animated gif have expanded the language, but they also lean toward hyperextended meanings, rather than the subtle cues of body language.

If texting is a new language, the medium of that language is our phones and fingers. We talk with our hands, would it be possible text with gestures?

We added simple gestures to give texts intonation.  
\- Type a word and swipe up to give it emphasis.  
\- Swipe across to convey direct approval.  
\- A sharp spike indicates a problem or hesitation.  
\- Type a word, press with one thumb and scrub through gestures with your other thumb.

Gestures preempt the need for multiple keyboards, drop downs or libraries that get in the way of a conversation.

This richer text message can be read with or without the gestural signature. If the recipient swipes up, they can hear the message read by their OS with more intonation and meaning.

Like our own body language, text gestures do not have to map to a word or emotion. They provide another subtle layer of meaning that natural and generous.

We call this approach Intonated Text.

\## Potential  
Intonated Text has implications for AI and accessibility.  
Imagine simply sending a gesture without even using a word.   
Over time, your AI operating system is trained to understand your inflections as your personal voice. So that even when you don’t add a gesture, your AI can imply your intent and express it vocally.

ok, check this out. maybe this is a setting or just another offering BUT:

the gesture could also be a range of effects to put on the word or phrase. fuzzy, dim, a color or [http://www.laikafont.ch/](http://www.laikafont.ch/)

\## Vision / Mission  
Text Messages are a rapidly evolving pidgin language. Like pidgin languages, it is the byproduct of graphing one technology (aka culture) onto another or new technology. Within a generation, the rules of the language settle and there is little innovation after that time. Given the obvious difference between text messages and Cajun, its anyone’s guess whether text messaging as a language will follow the same rules.  
Given that text messages have become the defect way we talk to one another in a distributed network, there is a lot nuance that has been lost and there is a lot of opportunity to explore what text messages could be.  
We think that text messages could borrow from humans talk and how the web talks. Like the web, we believe text messages should not be proprietary. Like conversations, we believe they should be layered and a pastiche of available material. Always inventing, always combinatorial.   
It’s tempting to hand text messages off to AI, but we think that communication cannot be reduced to data. There is always life, joy, mystery and misunderstanding that gives vitality to our communication, and that is most true in the condition of conversation.  
Text Messages as a language could evolve to include instagram filters and snapchat masks, who knows.

We like to hear it in our head  
The same way a radio show would conjure scenes in our heads.

But someone may read alright alright alright and read frustration rather than Matthew mcconoghy

A diacritic gesture would fix that, but you’d still hear it in your head.

If texts had an additional layer of meaning, text with intonations through simple gestures, messages

There are a few reasons that texts are a thin channel of communication.

Exaptation

Because text is informal and immediate,

It is actually a new language, like a pidgin language that is evolving rapidly in this new environment.

When we text, we are speaking to each other in a distributed conversation.
