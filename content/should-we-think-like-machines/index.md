Which is better?

> **4 + 4–5 + 3** or **(- 5 (+ 4 4 3))**?

The first method is standard notation, the way we’ve done arithmetic since time began. The second method is Clojure, written in 2005. Clojure is faster because its written in such a way that the computer immediately knows what to do with the operation. 

  

The real question is whether the first method imitates the way we think or is it just a bad habit.

But why use Clojure at all? 

Rich Hickey created Clojure 

The first version is easy but is it more natural than the second? The second version is written in Clojure, a Lisp language that is easier for the machine to read. Is the Clojure equation less human or just less familiar?

From a UX perspective, the machine should be serve our needs, therefore **4 + 4 - 5 + 3** is the way to go. But **(- 5 (+ 4 4 3))** will pretty much always be read faster by a computer, which means a faster machine. Faster machine, better UX.

Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, believes that we should think more like computers, at least when it comes to equations. If we do the simple mental shift of putting the operator first, we can think more like the machine and save it some processing time.

We think like our tools all the time. Our brains easily adapt to guitars, cars and keyboards. We become experts at them, bending them to our will. But in reality, we’ve learned to work within the constraints of the machine.

George Orwell felt this applied to language as well. In the book 1984 by George Orwell, the official language is designed to limit undesirable ideas to keep society running efficiently. 

  

  

When I ask which of the two programs above is more human, I’m not talking to developers. I’m asking whether we’re going to start shifting our basic unconscious interactions to be more machine-friendly. LOL

  

  

  

Next to talking, writing is one of the most natural things that we do. Writing has already been disrupted with the invention of the keyboard. Many of us use the keyboard more than pen and paper. (When you use a keyboard, you’re letting the machines win!)

  

  

  

Taking that a few steps further, what if our spoken language was something like HTML? Can you imagine hitting on a girl with HTML?
