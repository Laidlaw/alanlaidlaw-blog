_“Software is eating the world,”_ is a common refrain but what does it mean exactly? On the surface, it implies that old industries are getting disrupted by startups who have new technology that can do more with less money. They are smarter and faster. They are a more evolved human race and they will inevitably wipe us out. (xmen)

I doubt the future will shake out this way, but there is an important point to take away. It isn’t just the software that is eating the world, but the culture and processes that shaped the software. They all get shipped together.

So let’s start over and seek out a more cohesive viewpoint.

#### Technology destroys Methodology

Pretend our ancestors pummeled the wooly mammoth to death with their fists. 50 people were needed for one mammoth and many of them were killed. One team focused on punching the nose and eyes while another team pulled the wooly hair.

No surprise that the spear changed all that. Many cavemen who spent their lives perfecting the craft of eyeball-punching had to find new work. For hundreds of years, that’s all they and their families knew how to do. 

Technology gets us to our goal more quickly, it shortens the path. That path is a method, an assembly line of smaller tasks to reach the desired result. Sometimes that method is around for so long that it becomes a ritual. The path itself becomes the goal. The rituals over time become a religion.

#### Technology destroys Religion

Yeah, it’s that bad. Just as cave paintings 

  

process is how we do things. methodology is how we think about those processes and how they shape us. it’s obvious that tech changes processes —that is the purpose of technology. But it is less obvious how tech changes or wipes out methodology. Its as if, with nothing in the physical world to anchor itself to, previous methodologies just drift away and evaporate from thought. methodology is that ingrained combination of process and thought — the kind of training between a master and apprentice, sergeant and soldier.

just as rituals become religions, methodologies become philosophies. Yep, tech also wipes out philosophies.
