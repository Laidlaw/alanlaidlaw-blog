Fantastic observation, Paul.

I’ve been noticing the same pattern, but I had been thinking about it in terms of Models, Views and Controllers. The web could be the Model. And all these highly-opinionated browsers (apps) could be the Views.

Right now the web is an unmaintainable mess. That’s because some time ago, we traded convention for configuration — enabling websites to distinguish themselves but at a great cost. The user gets lost. Facebook, Instapaper and the rest seem both easier and safer.

I think the web community is returning to convention (hence of the popularity of front-end frameworks) but we need to take our mental model of the web back farther. The web needs to get ugly again.

If we shift our focus from discrete solutions (products) to systems solutions (protocols) — if we start thinking in the way the web was first imagined, really really cool stuff could happen.

-   First, the web would be like Github, a free repo of interlaced content, Facebook and Apple could not compete with it.
-   Rather than front-end or back-end developers, we’d have content and context developers. Content developers work with clients to crafts APIs that best match with their message. Context developers work on making better views for the end-user, pulling in various APIs and rendering them in novel ways.
-   As views, apps and browsers could start displaying information in more novel and more valuable ways because content would threaded with contextual cues. (Think markdown or OPML.)
-   Articles would evolve into automata, little choose your own adventure games.
-   …

I’m going to stop there. The room is silent. I’m just going to tip-toe backwards out the door and draft a think-piece.
