I don’t recall what he said, but I knew the man sitting beside me on the train was blind. He held his phone like a remote control and said something into it that ended with “exclamation point.”

This was years ago and I had never heard someone say “exclamation point” into a phone. I still remember how it blew my mind — like the first time doors swished open because they sensed me.

> His words turned into a **command!**

It also reminded me of the CLI.

The **Command Line Interface** (CLI) has no buttons or instructions, no recognizable interface at all, just a terrifying black screen that has the power to melt your computer. It’s known as the Terminal — for good reason. Hackers use it in the movies.

Developers know the CLI like the back of their hand. In it, they use tools like bash, vim, git, zsh, markdown, etc — to quickly traverse folders and files, find and manipulate code, save the code in versions and branches, pull down and build entire applications with a single phrase. You can daisy chain processes on each other so that what you’ve written is as inscrutable as it is fleeting. Don’t think of this as code. This is writing with fight combos.

```
git commit -m "heres how I really feel" && cd ../projects'
```

> Think of it as a choreographed fight scene with great dialogue.

As far as I know, there is no term for this blend of word and code, but there should be. 

Let me explain.

Right now, I’m using markdown (one of those shorthands used in the CLI) to write this article. If I preface a statement with a hashtag it will be converted into a dom element. 

```
`#title` becomes `<h1>Title</h1>`
```

Super simple.

  

At the most basic level, you are using markdown when you say “exclamation point” into your phone. But what else could we do if we thought of our phone as a CLI?
