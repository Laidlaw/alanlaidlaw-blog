### Enhancing the Employer Roadmap

Employer Roadmap is an educational site for hiring managers to learn more about hiring veterans and spouses of veterans.

While I was working on the National Guard timeline, I was also renegotiating a contract with the US Chamber of Commerce to improve Employer Roadmap. That team was tied up in a prior project that was months behind schedule. They had no time for Employer Roadmap.

The new contract had to do two things: give us more time and restrain the scope. The current contract was as broad as the Louisiana Purchase, and we were the French. One feature was defined as “an app to help employers write better veteran-friendly job descriptions.”

That bullet point could be a company.

Usability testing, iteration-driven design and really good communication skills come in handy when renegotiating a contract. It grounds you. Being both a developer and a designer that has been charged with building things that just don’t make sense,

A little background — I was part of the original Employer Roadmap’s design. We were given 32 articles about how to hire veterans. It was certain that almost no one would read them. The contract was written with print in mind, not a website. So the goal of the design was to make the content discoverable with great information architecture. We broke the articles down into three major categories and dozens of collections in hopes that it would make the content easier to consume. We also used some pretty slick UI for 2014. The patterns we used in Employer Roadmap I have since seen on Vice.com, cnn.com, and Forbes.com.

While we had a slick UI and smart IA, we never validated those assumptions on users. That was the first thing I did as a project manager.

I found that half the people tested couldn’t get past the homepage. Here are a few other questions I heard:

> Who are these people?

> Why do I have to sign in?

> What am I supposed to do?

The homepage featured a massive stock photo and a bold message that was hidden behind an abrasive modal window. The user had to make an account but were given no guidance about how to navigate the site. The hamburger menu in the top left corner that contained all the content completely failed.

User testing gave me the foothold I needed to go in front of the client and suggest a new contract, for more time and more money — because it addressed the real goal of the site. I was confident that we’d see a significant increase in user engagement if we implemented the UX changes I was suggesting. They signed the contract.

Every product should have a sentence. It doesn’t have to be a pitch, it can just be a reminder. For the new Employer Roadmap, our sentence was “People don’t have the time.” We set out to redesign the sign for busy people who have just a few minutes in their day to learn about hiring veterans.

We got rid of the stock photography and poor typography. We got rid of the boxes and sidebars. We drastically simplified the layout. We got rid of the clever UI (for the most part, we actually created some pretty cool new patterns). Then we slashed the buckets and collections. I’m tempted to go point by point into all ways that Employer Roadmap was a landmark redesign. It has more subtly and sophistication than any other application we’ve built. Best of all, it builds on the components that were built in the National Guard Timeline.
