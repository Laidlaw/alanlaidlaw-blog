On Sept 12, Apple dazzled the world with a new flavor of baby food in the form of Animoji. Itâ€™s easy to praise this feature or to bury it. Is Apple is a botoxed cougar desperate for the attention (and marketshare) of the youth? Or is part of a longer Augmented Reality strategy? Iâ€™m not going to spend too much time on either.Â 

Iâ€™m more concerned with how the principles of product management are hurting us. Product Management, as we think of it today, was born in an incubator in Silicon Valley and has spread throughout the world as _the way_ to make a successful product.Â 

Itâ€™s the art of gaining users, adoption, usage, market share and global conquest.Â 

> But what happens after your product has won the world? What do you conquerÂ next?
