### A Model for Non-linear writing.

  

#### Imagine you are listening to an audiobook by Neil Degrasse Tyson.

#### He says something intriguing about a black hole.

  

  

#### But then moves right on, talking about quanta.

> **_Stop,_**

_you say._ 

> **_Tell me more about the black hole!_**

  

  

He stops. Says the statement again and elaborates on it. He starts to dive into the numbers.

You ask a few more questions and he, sensing your curiosity, suggests some resources to check out. They’ll be emailed to you, if you like.

### This is an example of a branching narrative. 

In the same way that stories are becoming more experiential, they could become more intelligent.
