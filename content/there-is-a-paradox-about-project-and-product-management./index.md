There is a paradox about project and product management. If your biggest concern is time, you may think you need a project manager — not a product manager. But I’ve seen project managers completely blow the deadline because they don’t understand what is being built. _Their_ **_procedure_** _is their product._

When you’re running out of time, following a process shouldn’t be your biggest concern. You need a firefighter who knows how to alter the process and set priorities to get to the finish line.
