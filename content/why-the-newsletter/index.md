So I bet you’re wondering why you joined this weekly newsletter. If you know me, you’re just morbidly curious about what the disaster this will become. _And I respect that._

For those of you who don’t know me, I have predicted every major **paradigm shift** in the tech industry. I predicted the rise of **conversational interfaces** and **bots**. Before that, I predicted **flat design**. I predicted **javascript**.

I have consumed every article, ebook, podcast and programming language that you will one day ever regret missing.

### Need proof? Here are some articles that I have read:

### Let Me Guide You

![](./asset-1.jpeg)

**Sudoscience**, like **COBOL** and **Project Xanadu**, was made to prepare us for the next paradigm shift, the Big One.

I’m already there, I’ve been down that path because I’ve already predicted it. It’s really bad and it’s not what you think. Except for AI, you got that right.

By subscribing to this newsletter, you are receiving a cairn in your inbox every week. A \*cairn\* is a pile of stacked rocks made in the wilderness by a journeyman or \*spiritually centered person\*. When it works, cairns warn you about dangerous turns in the future. But other times, cairns look like a dog shit art gallery.

Similarly, in **Sudoscience**, you’ll find the pomposity of a populist mixed with the charming and terrifying clumsiness of an autonomous drone learning to fly.
