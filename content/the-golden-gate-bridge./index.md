The Golden Gate Bridge.

Based on your first image, I was certain you were going to suggest a bridge. It is both grounded and elevated. More importantly, a bridge is generous. I always have a sense of gratitude when I approach a bridge, for the shape, the solution, and the people who built it. The logo wouldn’t even have to resemble the Golden Gate or the Uber “U” — that’d be stretching.

Thanks for the article!
