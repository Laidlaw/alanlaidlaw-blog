![Divining Rods are pseudoscience. ](./asset-1.jpeg)

When I’m sitting with a client, listening to their idea for the first time, I have to think fast to impress them. Oftentimes I’ll pull out my divining rod. I’ll stand up and stagger around the office as if being lead by some orthogonal force. 

> “I think I’ve got some UX over here!” _I will say to the client._

Other times I’ll use axioms like _“Keep It Simple”_ or _“Minimum Lovable Product.”_ They lead me to ask impressive sounding questions. 

For the record, _“Keep it Simple,”_ —  the Hippocratic oath for many UX designers — is a nice axiom, but it doesn’t help. Who doesn’t want to keep it simple? It’s a crap divining rod. The axioms I use are a little more gnarled. You may not like them.

1.  There is no spoon.
2.  Conversation is the ideal interface
3.  90% of UI is just showing up.
4.  We’re building tents, not homes.

### There is no spoon.

The interface is the beginning of any application you can think of, so it makes sense to start there. 

If you can solve a problem any other way, do it. If you can make a service that runs in the background, like electricity, go with that. 

The term “interface” is like the term “technology” because it has come to mean so many things. \_\_ defines technology as anything that was created within our lifetime. You could say the same thing about interfaces. If the problem has been solved, you don’t need an interface for it.

  

“Interface” is a tricky term. It has come to include so much that it means almost nothing at all. Our mouths can be oxygen interfaces, but that doesn’t help solve a problem.

### _Conversation is the Ideal Interface_

_focus, familiarity, & feedback_

#### Focus

A conversation is linear. It reveals one state at a time. A computer interface can show hundreds of states at one time. (If _state_ is an unfamiliar term, think of branches on a tree. The user can only see one branch at a time).

#### Familiarity

Conversation is organic. It is not a tool that requires a manual. Compare it to sign-up forms, infographics, or time-tracking software.

#### Feedback

Socrates preferred dialogue over manuscripts because he could respond to his students questions immediately. He could change the course of the dialogue.

#### Flexibility

Conversations exist on different timescales. One conversation can be a hurried cluster of texts. Another spans epochs. The fundamental mechanics of conversation do not break down.

These qualities are dependent on each other. The UI of conversations is naturally focused on the next step because there is immediate feedback. If the conversation suddenly stops — that’s when you start to look around and wonder where you’ve wound up.

  

### 90% of good UI is just showing up.

#### It’s all hyperlinks. The challenge is showing the right links at the right time.

_Don’t compare software design to architecture._
