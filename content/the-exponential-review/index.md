Around 2am every Sunday morning, [Azeem Ansar](https://medium.com/u/fd495452ec16) sends [_The Exponential View_](http://www.exponentialview.co/) to my inbox. Newsletters are not known for their artistry, but _The Exponential View_ is an exception.

He bundles thought-provoking articles into departments — dept of the near future, dept of autonomous cars — the departments change every week. There is little commentary and the art is in the interplay of the articles.

On the surface, the topics seem random, but they start to circle each other like they’re caught in a gravity well.

You may start to feel a tingle in the back of your neck, like a spidey-sense, as you read the articles. That tingle may get stronger, and might even lead to an epiphany or two. This epiphanic moment is _the Exponential View_.

#### [1\. Moral Economy of Tech](http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm)

The newsletter starts with a jaw-dropping [inditement of the tech industry’s arrogance, bias, and blindness](http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm) from a talk by Maciej Ceglowolski (aka Idlewords):

> As computer programmers, our formative intellectual experience is working with deterministic systems that have been designed by other human beings. These can be very complex, but the complexity is not the kind we find in the natural world. It is ultimately always tractable. Find the right abstractions, and the puzzle box opens before you.

When everything you see is reducible to boolean values, measurement becomes your religion. This is true for the developer, the data scientist and growth hacker, the CEO, and the lobbyist.

Peter Drucker said, **“Anything that can be measured can be managed.”** Progress becomes synonymous with performance, and performance must be measured.

Determinism has such a strong pull, we barely notice what it is ripping apart. The religion of measurement requires that we sacrifice whatever cannot be tracked.

I would compare it to color blindness, but it’s more like taking a photo of a city at night, [the photos never come out right.](https://medium.com/@cennydd/reflections-on-japan-2fd53fddfa8d#.5yo82z9t6)

> Our unique position as authors of software used by millions gives us power, but we don’t accept that this should make us accountable. We’re programmers — who else is going to write the software that runs the world? To put it plainly, we are surprised that people seem to get mad at us for trying to help.

Here is [Ceglowolski’s talk.](http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm)

In _To Save Everything, Click Here_, Evgeny Morozov explores this idea from a cultural perspective. He calls it **Solutionism** and it’s very American. If you want a kick, read that book and Kevin Kelly’s The Inevitable, at the same time!

> We are building an infrastructure of surveillance and algorithmic intelligence that will, in IMHO, shape the next 100 years. It’s a gift, like fossil fuels.

#### [2\. Culturally-constructed Ignorance](http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-27/culturally-constructed-ignorance-wins-the-day)

The politicians that architected Brexit [used culturally-constructed ignorance to achieve their goals](http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-27/culturally-constructed-ignorance-wins-the-day). Knowledge may be power, but ignorance is politics.

> “The tobacco industry is famous for having seen itself as a manufacturer of two different products: **tobacco and doubt.**”

> That doubt, however, allowed cigarette sales to continue for decades before the inescapable truth came to light. And it forestalled broader regulatory oversight by the states and the federal government for years. But the truth can only be held back for so long, and eventually tobacco sales in the U.S. fell off a cliff. But it was too late to [save millions](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/) of people who became sick and died due to smoking.

> Current agnotology campaigns seem to be having similarly desired effects.

#### [3\. Agnotology — The study of ignorance](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/opinion/the-case-for-teaching-ignorance.html)

The third link is about the study of ignorance. Not all ignorance is bad or intentional. Ignorance is vital to understanding. Ignorance fuels curiosity.

> The larger the island of knowledge grows, the longer the shoreline — where knowledge meets ignorance — extends. The more we know, the more we can ask. Questions don’t give way to answers so much as the two proliferate together. Answers breed questions. Curiosity isn’t merely a static disposition but rather a passion of the mind that is ceaselessly earned and nurtured.

### Observations

-   Software is eating the world but, perhaps a little more darkly, software trains programmers how to see. Programming provides feedback loops that are almost as [addictive as slot machines](https://soundcloud.com/officialsxsw/checkbox-that-ruined-my-life-manipulative-design-sxsw-interactive-2016).
-   Politicians are programmers of ignorance and doubt. They are probably hooked on the audience’s feedback.
-   But arrogance and ignorance are not all together evil. Arrogance breeds innovation. Ignorance breeds curiosity.

> In three simple links, Mr. Azhar has done more than most novels. He’s built a world of countervailing forces that my spin head around. It’s like unsupervised learning, for humans.



I’m not worried (yet) about our inevitable robot overlords, but I am worried that we will never have a conversation about it.

The Exponential View is especially relevant now. Technology will begin to govern our work, our privacy, and our probably our perception. We do not yet know how to govern technology. Or even how to talk about it. It is too easy to turn technology into another case of cultivated ignorance.

I love The Exponential View because it turns finds the holes in our arrogance and the curiosity in our ignorance.
