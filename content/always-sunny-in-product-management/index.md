**_I’ve worked for several product managers and I’ve been one myself._**  
Dennis: The Bad PM  
Bad product managers only care about KPIs. A bad and clever product manager may think he’s a player, a master of manipulation and seduction. He’ll “neg” the team, amplifying stress and conflict in order to make

like defining arbitrary deadlines even though the team is moving at a good pace.   
will use techniques to upset our baseline, things like comepletely insane deadlines, because they think they can seduce a good product out of us through stress and misdirection.

Charlie: The Good PM  
But that’s not what a good product manager is like. And I’m sorry if you’ve experienced a good product manager.

A good product manager generates ideas to help the conversation, but doesn’t need to them. The ideas are currents, and eventually create a flow of innovation form the team.   
The goal isn’t to hit a deadline, though constraints aren’t ignored.   
A good PM  
A good product manager uses constraints as material, and the ideas and enthusiasm of the team as material. The good PM works through the shifting priorities of bosses with pleasure, because it just adds to the mix. The good PM knows that there is a product at the core of all the forces that when discovered will work like an atomic bond.   
(Kitten mittens)  
And that’s why time is not something the PM fights. When that simple core idea is discovered, the tide shifts. Development and design fall into the flow. Everything gravitates toward the atomic bond. And it makes the product easier to make and easier to ship.  
A good PM knows the chemical nature of a strong idea. And has seen how effective the strong idea is over the product factory mentality.  
That’s why a good PM hardly ever defines success by KPIs. The good idea hasn’t surfaced yet and the KPIs are just thunderstorms, adding energy in the background but oblivious to the solution.   
(If PMs have good leaders who are also PMs, those KPIs might just line up. But I have never seen that.)

(Not extending the metaphor. Mac is not a dev. Bird is not a designer. Nope)
