“For instance, I was just talking to that girl and I asked if she was single. She wasn’t, but it’s a thing I do. Just to get it out there. Eventually someone will say they’re single. Why can’t I use machine learning for that?”

I didn’t know where to start. 

We were at a dinner party. I was going on about how different applied machine intelligence is in retail from what’s heard in the news. I started to try to explain the difference between data and intuition but it wasn’t registering. He wanted to know why it would be so difficult for machine learning to spit out a prediction about whether the girl would say she was single or not.

“Let’s pretend that every time you asked a girl if she was single, that was immediately recorded in an excel file and you didn’t have to do anything,” I said. The time was recorded, the dialogue, and the result. And pretty soon you had enough encounters that you could feed that data into a machine learning algorithm. What pattern do you think the algorithm would find?”

“It would probably base its prediction on the time of day. That’s the data where it would be easiest to find a pattern. Maybe the closer you are to 3pm, the more likely the subject will be single.” 

“But you know that has nothing to do with it. So maybe you start tracking more data, like the space between words. Maybe you can even codify body language. Whatever you give the algorithm, it’ll find a pattern.”

But ultimately, you’re trying to determine the likelihood of their attraction to you and there are so many other variables to consider. There may be variables that have nothing to do with you or her. What if the size of the venue is a factor, or the density of people. How much do you track?
