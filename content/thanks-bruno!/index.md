Thanks, Bruno! You bring up a couple of issues that I’m going to try to tackle in the next article. My goal for this article was to present a different metaphor than “the walled garden” but we have to be very careful when applying metaphors to the web, it has a way of slipping through them. 

Will the audience decide what’s next for the web? When the web was first invented by Tim Berners-Lee, CERN didn’t care for it. Very few saw its value. But people like the web browser. It was an alternative to magazines. Marc Andreessen picked up on that thirst and turned it into a great business. 

So in a way, you’re right. The web became obsessed with its looks because of the users drove the development. But the true value of the web was something we didn’t understand until about a decade later. I think we are seeing a return to form for the web, a sort of _Classical Era_ that is more interested in protocols than products.

Protocols and systems are seldom products because the user only sees a small portion of it. At its root, I think that’s why people are fighting for the open protocol of the web over the closed-off interests of products.

But I’ll discuss this in the next installment.
